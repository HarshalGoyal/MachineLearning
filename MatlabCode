% Matrices are multidimensional arrays
% The ; denotes that we are going to a new row
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]

% Vector is an array with 1 column
% Initialize a vector
v = [1;2;3]

% Get the dimensions of matrix A where m = rows and n = columns
[m, n] = size(A)

% You could also store in this way
dim_A = size(A)

% Get the dimensions of vector A
dim_v = size(v)

%Now let's index in 2nd row and 3rd column of matrix A
A_23 = A(2, 3)
