% Initialze matrix A and B
A = [1, 2, 4; 5, 3, 2]
B = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1]

% Initialize constant s
s = 2

% Additon of matrix A and B
add_AB = A + B

% Substraction of matrix A and B
sub_AB = A - B

% Multiplcation of matrix A with scalar s
mult_As = A * s

% Dividing matrix A by scalar s
div_As = A / s

% Directly adding matrix with scalar s
add_As = A + s

A / 3
